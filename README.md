  ## Description :computer::dollar::credit_card:	
  An internet retail company's back end e-commerce website. Utilizes latest technologies to be competitive with other e-commerce companies. 
  Packages this project utilize includes: Sequelize, Express, MySQL2, dotnv, along with the MySQL Workbench (DB) & API Routing.

  ## Installation :hammer_and_wrench:		
  The following steps were implemented to install this E-Commerce Back End Application functional.  
  * <em>Project Assignment included provided starter code</em>
  1. Model Files were initally built out utilizing sequelize.
    * Files includes a Category/Product/ProductTag/Tag.js files.
  2. Ids and Model data was written out into these 4 files. 
  3. The index.js file was then constructed to include and import all models.
  4. MySql Workbench had to be utilized to incorporate the db-schema.sql, in order to create the e-commerce database used in this application.
  5. All NPM Packages were verifed installed. (Sequelize, dotenv, Express, and mysql2)
  6. env file was updated with appropriate Database User, Password and Database name.
  7. Routes were then codes to reflect all necessary GET, PUT, DELETE and POST requests that were necessary to function.
  8. Async function needed to be built in to each route, as well as including the appropriate data from the necessary models.
  9. A many to many relationship was used to make these routes function correctly. 
  10. npm run seed was then used in the terminal, to use the functioning models and routes to load provided seed data.
  11. Routes were tested in Insomnia to make sure they function correcly with the database previously created in mysql workbench.

  ## Testing Instructions :test_tube:	
  1. MySQL Workbench needs to be loaded with pre-created e-commerce db database.
  2. Database should be seeded at this point, after installation instructions are completed.
  3. Terminal needs to be opened to back-end folders. npm start is then run, and you should read "App listening at PORT 3001".
  4. Now that you have a connection estabilisted you can manage the functionality from the back end of the application.

  ## Future Development :man_technologist:	
  * At date of assignment submital, I still have 2-3 API requests that while testing through Insomnia, are still outputting errors.  I am still working to develop and debug these routes, to have every one functioning correctly. - 6.22.21
